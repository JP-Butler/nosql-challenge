# Module 12 - nosql-challenge
---------------------------------------------------------------

## Eat, Safe, Love Ratings Data Evaluation
In this challenge I am a Data Scientistworking for the UK Food Standards Agency, and have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. I used my NoSQL database skills to modify and query data for analysis to answer the editor requests.
